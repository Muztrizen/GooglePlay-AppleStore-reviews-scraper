            "b'Dennis Xu',\"b\"\"We all know why we're choosing Ecosia as our browser. Great mission, great cause. I'm also pleasantly surprised by how usable it is. It's based on Chrome so the gestures and features will be very familiar for anyone switching over, but it feels even faster than Chrome (which I always thought was the standard for fast mobile browsing - based on load times and animations). It's a different search engine so that takes a bit to get used to, but so far the results give me what I need and expect.\"\"\",b'Rated 5 stars out of five stars',b'411',\"b'August 26, 2019'\",b''\r\n",

Not only it is reliable, I feel safer trusting my data in Ecosia than in Google, I also feel better looking at the tree counter, I don't know why but it calms my depression down, it's great. I use it everyday that I completely forgot about Google, I'm not joking. The application is getting better with every update. It is user friendly and very easy to browse through.

I do wish it remembered my settings, for example country of search (ie. I have to reset it to a different country every time I search if I want my results in the right language.

First I was little doubtful about this but then I kind of did a little research about this and then I came to conclusion that this Ecosia organization is planting trees. And the search on ecosia grew faster as hundreds of people are searching for every 0.8 seconds. I highly recommend everyone to use this app. I hope you'll also plant trees in and around Amazon Rainforest cause we all know the reason and other parts of Asia. Thank you.
